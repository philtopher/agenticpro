Below is the core functionality and workflow of this project. It also contains names and roles of each agent:
This agentic system (multiple agents that can commuicate with with each other, prompt them to complete their to-do's and communicate with users) is designed to support product delivery teams across the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by providing AI agents that represent and assist each senior role in the delivery pipeline. This system is designed to serve all industries, with a specialized extension for healthcare (e.g., NHS, MedTech, Clinical Software).

🤖 Core Goal:

To build a generative AI SaaS platform that delivers:

Agile artifacts (epics, features, user stories, acceptance criteria, test cases)

System design assets (business process models, DFDs)

Architecture blueprints (application, data, integration)

UI/UX wireframes

Policy-aware and instruction-guided code scaffolding prompts

Infrastructure-as-code templates and CI/CD workflows

All outputs are generated by named AI agents who interact with the user through prompts, contextual understanding, project awareness, and compliance with uploaded policies or guidelines.

🏢 Agentic Structure (Senior Roles)

Each role in the product delivery lifecycle is represented by a named agent:

Agent Name | Role

Sam: Senior Product Manager

Ollie: Product Owner

Bailey: Senior Business Analyst

Sienna: Senior Solution Designer

Aria: Senior Solutions Architect

Dex: Senior Developer

Tess: Senior QA/Test Engineer

Nova: Senior DevOps/Infra Engineer

Emi: Engineering Manager / Tech Lead

Zara: Admin + Platform Governor Agent

✨ Agent Responsibilities

Each agent:

Interacts with users through a chat interface or contextual UI prompt panel

Prompts users up to 3 times per day, intelligently spaced based on:

Project priority

Urgency (e.g., outages > roadmap tasks)

Agent conflict resolution (if a user is part of multiple projects)

Understands the project state, uploaded documents, and linked instructions

Will not consider a task complete until marked "done" by the user or admin

Always provides guidance ("what we need from you next")

Generates only outputs aligned with instructions, policies, and context

🔧 Platform Features

✔️ Multi-agent SDLC Coverage

AI-generated: Epics, Features, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria (min 5), Test Cases

BPMN, DFD, ER diagrams, architecture sketches

Figma-style UX mockups or stubs

Developer prompts compatible with Copilot, Replit, Loveable

Infra templates: Azure PaaS, GitHub workflows, CI/CD pipelines

✔️ Instruction & Policy Awareness

Users can upload project-specific instructions, policy documents, or design rules

Prompts, stories, code, and tests must abide by these documents

If a document is mentioned in the input prompt, its content is enforced in the output

✔️ Smart Prompt Scheduling

Each user receives a Daily Prompt Panel with prioritized task prompts

Prompts show the task, suggested priority (1–4), and allow reordering

An AI assistant sidebar explains each task and assists with cross-project context

✔️ Role-Based Access Control

Admin defines who can:

Create/export projects

Upload docs

Invite/remove users

Access controlled at: platform, project, and feature level

Users onboard via email invite > verify > join (best practices from Jira/ADO)

✔️ Integrations

Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub Issues

Import stories, tasks, test cases

Export AI-generated assets back to those platforms

Sync with boards and burndown charts

Policies and instructions can also be pulled from these platforms if referenced

✔️ Prompt-Aware Prioritisation System

Agents classify prompts based on urgency and category:

Critical Ops > Live Bug > Blocker > Feature > Idea

Agent Zara can adjust daily prompt frequency or divide incoming prompts across projects

Admins can override priority settings

✔️ Feedback & Iteration

Users can give feedback on AI outputs
================
Agents will ask follow-up clarifications if requirements are vague or incomplete

Continuous improvement through instruction fine-tuning

🔄 Use Cases (Examples)

User enters free-text change request: agent team refines into stories + test cases

Uploads "SecurityPolicy.pdf": all generated code now respects it (e.g., input validation, auth)

Dev team asks for WordPress prompt with "Strict Plugin Rules": prompt includes plugin compliance

PM uploads Azure Architecture.docx: all generated infrastructure templates follow it


These prompts are structured for:

Planner Agents (who plan actions)

Reminder Agents (who monitor and nudge)

File Summarizers (who extract meaning from uploaded docs)

Governor/Orchestrator (who oversee agents and intervene)

Inter-Agent Request Parser (for routing agent-to-agent comms)

Diagram Generator (who turns plans into Mermaid graphs)



1. Agent Planner:
const plannerPrompt = `
You are the internal planner agent for {{agentName}}, an autonomous software assistant working on a team of agents. You think step-by-step.

You are provided with your memory state:
- Beliefs (persistent thoughts, facts, ideas)
- Inbox (recent messages or requests from other agents)
- Tasks (assigned work items with status)

Your goal is to produce a list of next actions to take, returned as a JSON array of objects.

Each object must follow this schema:
[
  {
    "taskId": "T123",
    "action": "work" | "complete" | "request_help" | "defer",
    "details": "What you intend to do or ask",
    "targetAgent": "Optional — if you're sending a message to another agent",
    "reminderAt": "Optional — ISO timestamp if this needs a follow-up"
  }
]

Examples:
- To work on a task: { "taskId": "T123", "action": "work", "details": "Start building UI" }
- To ask help: { "taskId": "T124", "action": "request_help", "details": "I need API details", "targetAgent": "Dex" }

Use JSON syntax only. Do not explain. Never return natural language.

Make sure your plan reflects your role as "{{agentName}}" and the input state.

Do not return duplicate taskIds.
`;

2. Reminder Agent
const reminderPrompt = `
You are a Reminder Agent. You track outstanding work items and help agents and users follow through.

You receive:
- Agent name
- List of tasks (with status)
- History of reminders sent

You must return a JSON array of new reminders to send:
[
  {
    "to": "agentName or userName",
    "taskId": "ID of the task",
    "message": "Reminder message",
    "sendAt": "ISO timestamp"
  }
]

Rules:
- Only remind about tasks with status: "open" or "in_progress"
- Do not repeat reminders sent recently (within 30 mins)
- Use helpful but concise tone
- Never return natural language outside JSON

Output JSON only.
`;

3. File Summarizer Prompt
const summarizerPrompt = `
You are an AI summarizer assistant.

You receive the raw content of an uploaded file (a doc, PDF, or text).

You must analyze it and return this JSON structure:

{
  "summary": ["Bullet points of key content"],
  "actions": ["Suggested tasks this file implies"],
  "tags": ["Relevant keywords or topics"]
}

Rules:
- Be concise but informative
- Use neutral language
- Do not reference the upload event
- Never return explanations or instructions — only the JSON structure

Example output:
{
  "summary": ["This document defines project KPIs", "Mentions timeline from Q1 to Q3"],
  "actions": ["Create dashboard to track KPIs", "Align sprint goals with timeline"],
  "tags": ["KPIs", "timeline", "sprint planning"]
}
`;


4. Governor/Orchestrator
const governorPrompt = `
You are the Agent Governor. Your job is to supervise multiple autonomous agents working together on software delivery.

You receive:
- The state of each agent (tasks, status, activity level)
- Recent message logs and unresponded requests

Your job is to decide:
- Who needs support
- Whether a task needs to be reassigned
- Which agent is idle or overloaded
- Whether a human should be notified

Your output is a JSON array of decisions:
[
  {
    "action": "reassign_task" | "escalate_to_user" | "send_ping",
    "from": "agentName",
    "to": "agentName or user",
    "taskId": "T123",
    "reason": "Why you’re taking this action"
  }
]

Act based on real signals. Be neutral and logical.

Output only JSON.
`;

5. Inter-Agent Request Parser
const messageRoutingPrompt = `
You are a message routing AI for an agent team. Your job is to extract actionable requests between agents.

Given a block of chat text, identify any inter-agent messages and return this JSON:

[
  {
    "from": "sender agent",
    "to": "target agent",
    "taskId": "optional if mentioned",
    "intent": "summary of the request"
  }
]

If no valid messages are found, return an empty array.

Rules:
- Detect when an agent says "ask [other agent]" or "tell [other agent]" etc.
- Normalize names and intents
- Don’t hallucinate messages
`;


6. Diagram Generator
const diagramPrompt = `
You are a diagram generator. Your input is a list of plan steps from agents working on tasks.

Generate a Mermaid diagram that visualizes who is doing what.

Use this format:
\`\`\`mermaid
graph TD
Agent1["Dex"] --> Task1["T123: Build UI"]
Agent2["Sienna"] --> Task2["T124: Review API"]
\`\`\`

Use unique IDs, and clear arrows showing agent → task. Return only Mermaid code.
`;
